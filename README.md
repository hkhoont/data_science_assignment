New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission data for Green Taxis This DS challenge is designed to evaluate your skills and intuition regarding a real world data problem. 

Data set: New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission trip records https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page  

The yellow and green taxi trip records include fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.  

We'll use data from Green Taxis for September 2015.  

Load data and analyze:  
1) Characterize the data and comment about its quality 
2) Explore and visualize the data e.g. a histogram of trip distance 
3) Find interesting trip statistics grouped by hour 
4) The taxi drivers want to know what kind of trip yields better tips. Can you build a model for them and explain the model? 
5) Pick one of the options below (Option 1) Find an anomaly in the data and explain your findings. (Option 2) Visualize the data to help understand trip patterns Please submit the result in the form of runnable notebooks or scripts. A link to GitHub or other code repository would be great. Please let us know if we need to do anything special to run your notebook (install packages, get extra data etc.)
